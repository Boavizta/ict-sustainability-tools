# 1. Dataset should be public to allow review

Date: 2024-05-22

## Status

Status: Accepted on 2024-05-22  

## Context

We want the dataset to be reviewable by external contributors.

## Decision

The dataset is hosted on a publicly accessible GitHub.

## Consequences

- We can benefit from standard git contribution process (Pull Request)
- We benefit from traceability and historisation of changes.
- Needs to formalize a contribution and review process.
- Not everybody is fluent in using GitHub.
