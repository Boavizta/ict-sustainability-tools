## Getting started 🚀: visualize the data

Visualize or edit the data set at [https://boavizta.github.io/ict-sustainability-tools/](https://boavizta.github.io/ict-sustainability-tools/)

## User manual

Check [how to use the tool](/doc/user-manual/how-to-use-the-tool.md).


## Technical details

### Raw data (CSV)

See the [CSV dataset](ictst/data/tools.csv)

### Data model

This repository proposes a common data model that is used to reference all the tools or services.

The [data model](ictst/model/tools.frictionless-table-schema.json) of the raw data CSV file is described using the [frictionless-table-schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io//table-schema/).

> [!WARNING]
> The data model is still very drafty and is expected to evolve.

### Documentation
