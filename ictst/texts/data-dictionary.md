* TBQ: To be Qualified

## Life Cycle Steps ([life_cycle_steps])**‚úÖ**

Qualify which steps of a Life Cycle Assessment are tracked. Minimum coverage is usually ‚Äúusage‚Äù when only the energy consumed during the use phase is taken into consideration. This field enables also to qualify the scope(s) being covered for the GWP indicator (GHG emissions in CO2e). Usual steps of an [ISO 14040:2006 LCA](https://www.iso.org/standard/37456.html) are eligible:

* Extraction
* Manufacturing
* Transport
* Usage
* End of life
* Not Applicable
* Undisclosed
* TBQ: To be Qualified

## GHG scope covered ([ghg_scope])**‚úÖ**

This category makes it easy to link the product view (life cycle steps) with the Corporate Standard (company scopes), for educational purposes.

If GWP is checked in the environmental indicator field, this field indicates which scopes are covered (following [GHG protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/) Corporate Standard):

* Scope 1 and 2 (market-based)
* Scope 1 and 2 (location-based)
* Scope 1, 2 (market-based) and 3
* Scope 1, 2 (location-based) and 3

Should be aligned with the Life Cycle Steps (no scope 3 can be indicated if Manufacturing is not included in the Life Cycle Steps).
