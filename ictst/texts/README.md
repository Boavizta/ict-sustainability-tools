# üó∫Ô∏è Mapping of the ICT Sustainability Tools Landscape

This repository aim at providing to the global IT Sustainability community a vendor-neutral, fact-based, non-judgmental and exhaustive repository of the tools and services available to assess the environmental footprint of IT components.

It defines a data model that can be used to build an inventory of the tools.

> [!CAUTION]
> Today, any data contained in this repository is not validated nor reviewed. It is likely that the data contains completely false assumptions. It is here as sample data for the sole purpose of development and testing of the model. It should NOT be used for anything else.

> [!WARNING]
> The data model is still very drafty and is expected to evolve.
