The CO2 score is lowered by 10% if hosted with a provider using renewable energy (or offseting it) as that is roughly the amount of energy used transmitting the data from the server to the network. While Beacon checks your hosting provider; it cannot determine the difference between hosts using renewable energy or offseting their carbon footprint – this is down to the data source we are using (The Green Web Foundation) and will be monitored in case this data does become available.
